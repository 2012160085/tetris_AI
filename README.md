# tetris_AI
4-wide combo tetris bot.  <br/>



How it works
---
It works differently depending on the **state**.<br/>
There are two **states**, **build state** and **combo state**.<br/>
In **build state**, a neural network model called **Felix**(*from wreck it ralph*) piles tetris blocks up in 6 wide <br/>
to makes combo from it in **combo state**.
And other neural network model called **state observer** watch the game and decides when to go from one to the other.<br/>
<br/>
*will be added..*
